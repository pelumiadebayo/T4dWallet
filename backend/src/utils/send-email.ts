/**
 * Sends an email using a specified SMTP transporter.
 * 
 * This function uses the nodemailer package to create a transport for sending emails
 * via the Brevo SMTP relay. It retrieves authentication credentials from environment variables
 * and logs the status of the email sending process.
 * 
 * @param options - The options for the email to be sent, which should conform to the 
 *                  SendMailOptions interface provided by nodemailer. This includes fields 
 *                  like the recipient's email address, subject, and body of the email.
 * 
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to void when the email has been processed.
 *          Note: The actual sending is handled asynchronously and logged via callbacks.
